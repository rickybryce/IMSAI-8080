<h1>IMSAI 8080 Decimal, Hexadecimal, Octal, and Binary Counter</h1>
<p>This file will count from 0 to 255 in decimal displaying the conversions for each common numbering system on your console.  
  The IMSAI Output LED's will also display the binary bit pattern.</p>
  <p>Sensor Swtiches (Address switches 8-15) determine the length of the delay loop.</p>
  <p>Switches 6 and 7 ONLY will exit to CP/M.</p>
  <p>This should assemble in both Z80ASM by SLR systems, and the AZ80 Assembler.
